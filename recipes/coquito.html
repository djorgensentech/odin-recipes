    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad! (<em>Brandy, allrecipes.com</em>)</p>
    <p>This is a recipe that I want to try out this year for Christmas. I will make it non-alcoholic, so those ingredients have been removed.</p>
